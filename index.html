    <h3><span>Role: </span>Team member</h3>
    <h3><span>Title: </span>Shopping Online Grocery Application Using Advanced QR Code Metodology</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>The purpose of this project is to facilitate and give people the ability
         to keep track of the groceries they are buying off market and Using QR CODE. Buying of groceries
          is a daily or weekly task for most of the people, the problem here is; people tend to forget or
           cannot keep track of what they are buying, they use traditional techniques of pen and paper to
            remember the groceries they have to buy. I have solved the problem by providing the digital 
            inventory of products to choose from before going to the market and also keep track of what 
            they have previously purchased on the go i.e. providing all these features on their android 
            smartphone. This will result in people having more productivity and saving of time. QR codes,
             developed by a Japanese company in 1994 (after the invention of smart phones which was 
             invented in the year 1992), have been around for over fifteen years. With the advent of 
             smart and Web capable mobile devices, we witness a steady growth of interesting commercial
              applications using QR codes. The "QR" is derived from "Quick Response", as the creator 
              intended the code to allow its contents to be decoded at high speed. QR Codes are common
               in Japan, where they are currently the most popular type of two dimensional codes. Moreover,
                most current Japanese mobile phones can read this code with their camera.</h3>
